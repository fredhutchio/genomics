# Genomics training materials

This repository contains general information about learning genomic and bioinformatic analysis through fredhutch.io.

## Coursework 

### Genomics courses

- [Bulk RNAseq analysis](https://github.com/fredhutchio/rnaseq)
- [Single cell RNAseq analysis](https://github.com/fredhutchio/scRNAseq): analyzing data from single-cell RNAseq experiments,
which applies skills from both Unix and R

### Pre-requisite courses

The following classes provide skills necessary for performing genomic analyses.
See genomics course descriptions for specific pre-requisites. 

- [Data for Data Science](https://github.com/fredhutchio/data_for_data_science), which describes the data management skills essential for working with many large genomics data files
- [Intro to Unix](https://github.com/fredhutchio/unix_shell_intro): introduction to unix/bash shell scripting,
used for pre-processing and filtering raw genomic data
- [Intro to R](https://github.com/fredhutchio/r_intro): introduction to R statistical programming,
used for statistical comparisons and visualization of genomic data
