# Genomics training materials

## Description

This repository contains materials related to genomics training through fredhutch.io.

Modules currently in development are listd here: [`topics`](topics/).

Other repositories relevant to genomics training include:
- [Data for Data Science](https://github.com/fredhutchio/data_for_data_science), which describes the data management skills essential for working with many large genomics data files
- [Intro to Unix](https://github.com/fredhutchio/unix_shell_intro): introduction to unix/bash shell scripting,
used for pre-processing and filtering raw genomic data
- [Intro to R](https://github.com/fredhutchio/r_intro): introduction to R statistical programming,
