# Genomics traing materials

## Description

This repository contains materials related to development of genomics training as a part of fredhutch.io.

Areas to cover in training are currently summarized in [`topics/](topics/).

Other repositories relevant to genomics training include:
- [Data for Data Science](https://github.com/fredhutchio/data_for_data_science), which describes the data management skills essential for working with many large genomics data files
- [Intro to Unix](https://github.com/fredhutchio/unix_shell_intro): introduction to unix/bash shell scripting,
used for pre-processing and filtering raw genomic data
- [Intro to R](https://github.com/fredhutchio/r_intro): introduction to R statistical programming,
used for statistical comparisons and visualization of genomic data
- [scRNAseq](https://github.com/fredhutchio/scRNAseq): analyzing data from single-cell RNAseq experiments,
which applies skills from both Unix and R
