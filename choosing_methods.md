# Choosing bioinformatics methods 

Making decisions about analyses: 
- what algorithms
- parameters
- compute methods (see choosing_compute.md)

Why use a particular method? 
- Other people in the lab use it (consistency with previous analysis, for comparison purposes) 
- Other published literature uses it 
- Published literature comparing methods says itâ€™s appropriate 
- software manual says it's the best way
